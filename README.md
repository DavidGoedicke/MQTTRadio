# MQTTRadio

I noticed that on ```mqtt.eclipseprojects.io``` the BBC publishes "real time" transcripts of their radio shows.

This simple script waits for one sentence to finish and starts speaking it outloud.

Requires the ``paho.mqtt`` & ``pyttsx3`` python packages.

## Running 

```shell
python3 MQTTRadio.py
```
